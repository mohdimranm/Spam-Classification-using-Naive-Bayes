## Spam-Classification-using-Naive-Bayes

Bayes theorem is one of the earliest probabilistic inference algorithms developed by Reverend Bayes (which he used to try and infer the existence of God no less) and still performs extremely well for certain use cases.
The Bayes theorem calculates the probability of a certain event happening(in our case , a message being spam) based on the joint probabilistic distributions of certain other events(in our case, a message being classified as spam).
